 * CWE: 190 Integer Overflow
 * BadSource: fscanf Read data from the console using fscanf()
 * GoodSource: Set data to a small, non-zero number (two)
 * Sinks: multiply
 *    GoodSink: Ensure there will not be an overflow before multiplying data by 2
 *    BadSink : If data is positive, multiply by 2, which can cause an overflow
 * Flow Variant: 84 Data flow: data passed to class constructor and destructor by declaring the class object on the heap and deleting it after use
