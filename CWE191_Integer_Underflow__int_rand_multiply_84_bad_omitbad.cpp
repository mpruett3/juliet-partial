 * Sinks: multiply
 *    GoodSink: Ensure there will not be an underflow before multiplying data by 2
 *    BadSink : If data is negative, multiply by 2, which can cause an underflow
 * Flow Variant: 84 Data flow: data passed to class constructor and destructor by declaring the class object on the heap and deleting it after use
